# Final Project Summary
In this final project, the question that was asked was whether or not starting a population with more advanced properties would change the result of numerous evolutions. In order to test this, two populations were initialized, the first population had more advanced configurations during the randomization of the initial parents. The second population was limited in the amount of limbs and segments it can be created with. Evaluating the fitness as a value representing height achieved in proportion to initial height, the populations underwent multiple rounds of selection and mutation.
